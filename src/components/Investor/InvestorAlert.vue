              <br>
              CB offers trading services through the retail platform (the “Retail Platform”) or through its own trading desk based on the trade amount.
            </p>
            <p>The Client must be onboarded in accordance with provision 2 in these Terms whether the Client is using
              the Retail Platform and/or the trading desk.</p>
            <p>
              For Trading on the Retail Platform:
              <br>
              The Client is informed that in case of trading through the Retail Platform additional operational information is available as “FAQ” on the website of the Retail Platform. In case of contrary information, the stipulations according to these Terms prevail.
            </p>
            <p>The Retail Platform will be provided and supported by third parties. Therefore, CB shall become under no circumstances liable to the Client for any failure, damages, claims and/or losses from circumstances in connection with the Retail Platform.</p>
            <p>
              For Trading Through the Trading Desk:
              <br>
              After being successfully onboarded and approved, the Client will have assigned an account manager from CB (the “Account Manager”).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Client can contact the Account Manager to request a quote for a given crypto-asset that is traded by CB.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Account Manager can then offer the Client a quote. The quote is valid for 10 minutes after it has been set forth. The Client can either accept, reject or ignore the offer within said time limit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until the Client has accepted the offered quote, CB can at their sole discretion provide the Client with a new quote. The most recent provided quote shall be viewed as the binding offer to the Client and all previously quotes shall be annulled.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the offered quote is timely accepted in accordance with its content, the offered quote will be binding for both parties and CB will execute the order.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the offered quote is rejected, ignored or accepted too late, the offer will not become binding for either party and CB will not execute the offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the offered quote is timely accepted but with amendments to the content, it shall not be viewed as a binding accept but instead as a new quote request from the Client to which neither party is bound in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
              A pending quote-request from a Client shall under no circumstances be considered as a binding instruction or agreement to which either party is bound or committed in any way.
            </p>
            <p>The Clients acknowledges and accepts, that CB under no circumstances can be liable for the loss of profits and/or limitation of losses resulting from not being able to buy or sell in the period of which a quote request from the Client is pending.

              <br>
